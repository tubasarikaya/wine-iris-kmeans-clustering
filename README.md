# K-Means Clustering Analysis

This project aims to implement K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch and analyze its performance on Wine and Iris datasets with comprehensive evaluation metrics.

## Project Overview

The project implements K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch and performs detailed analysis on two different datasets (Wine and Iris). The study includes normalization impact analysis, optimal cluster number detection using Elbow and Silhouette methods, and performance evaluation using custom implementations of ARI (Adjusted Rand Index) and NMI (Normalized Mutual Information) metrics.

Key features include:
- Custom K-Means algorithm implementation
- Custom Silhouette score calculation
- Custom ARI (Adjusted Rand Index) implementation
- Normalization impact analysis (normalized vs non-normalized data)
- Elbow Method for optimal cluster detection
- Silhouette analysis for cluster quality assessment
- Comparative analysis between Wine and Iris datasets

Detailed analysis, visualizations, and results are available in the notebook file.
